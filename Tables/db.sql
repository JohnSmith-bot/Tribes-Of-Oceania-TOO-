This is due the long lineage the Aṉangu people have with the land. In their religion it is believed that their ancestors and ancient spirits rest there. The name given to the monument by the Aṉangu is ‘Uluru’, there is no direct translation to the english language, however it is similar to the words ‘crying’ and ‘shadows’ in the native language, ‘Yankunytjatjara’. The Idea of new life and life in general are very important to the Aṉangu people, this is due to the way their lives and culture revolve around Tjukurpa, which relates to their belief on how the world came to be. They believe that great ancestral beings created the world. These ancestral beings are; Hare Wallabies; Woma Pythons known as Kuniya in the Yankunytjatjara language; and Brown snakes known as Liru in the Yankunytjatjara language. It is believed by the Aṉangu peoples that a deadly battle occurred between the snakes in the name of revenge. A pregnant Kuniya had been cornered by a group of Liru causing the snake to fall off of Uluru to her death. Once news of this had reached the Kuniyas aunt on the other side of Uluru. She was overwhelmed with sorrow, grief and anger. She raced to the other side of the rock and confronted the gang of Liru where she was mocked for her grief and anger by the group. The Kuniya began dancing with immense power. She took to her wana (digging stick) and struck the head of the Liru, killing him. To celebrate their culture they hold sacred rituals and ceremonies .

The art features a lot of symbolism depicting spirits and ancestors that are believed to still be ‘alive’ yet moved on from the physical plain. Historically their architecture is seen as the antithesis (opposite) of the western style of building. The Australian aboriginals don’t care for the size or the power that comes with the westernised style of building nor do they have any interest in man made monuments.

Due to the colonisation of Tasmania, the Palawa population suffered significantly with an estimated 400 full blood Palawa remaining in 1835. It is believed that this demographic decline was due to the introduction of foreign diseases. All of the surviving Palawa were incarcerated. Australian historian, Geoffrey Blainey wrote, “Disease had killed most of them but warfare and private violence had also been devastating”. The violence being referred to is that of the Black War. The Black War is a term that is used in relation to the guerilla warfare that occurred between the aboriginal Tasmanians and the Europeans in efforts to colonise Tasmania. This started in the year 1804 and lasted until 1830. Many colonisation and genocide specialists such as Benjamin Madley an american author concluded that the colonisation efforts of tasmania should be considered genocide. “Could properly be labelled genocidal” talking about the black war. After 1876, there were only half blood Palawa left, resulting in the gradual loss of the aboriginal Palawa language.', 'The Palawa people traditionally lived in mud huts, however after their colonisation in 1803 their architectural style per se was westernised.
